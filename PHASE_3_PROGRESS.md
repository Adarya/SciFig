## üìÖ Started: June 2024
## üéØ Goal: Replace frontend mock data with real backend API calls

---

## üìã **Phase 3 Checklist**

### **Week 1: Core API Integration** üì±‚ÜîÔ∏èüñ•Ô∏è

#### **‚úÖ Priority 1: API Client Setup**

- [x] Handle async analysis results and loading states
- [x] Add progress indicators for long-running analyses

#### **‚úÖ Priority 3: File Upload Integration**
- [x] Connect frontend file upload to `POST /api/v1/files/upload`
- [x] Replace client-side CSV parsing with backend processing
- [x] Update file validation and preview components
- [x] Handle file upload progress and errors

### **Week 2: Authentication & State Management** üîê

#### **‚úÖ Priority 4: Authentication Flow**

## üéØ **Current Sprint: Project Persistence & Dashboard**

### **Now Working On:**
- Creating user dashboard with project management
- Implementing project sharing and collaboration features
- Connecting project history with analysis results

### **Success Criteria for Week 1:**
- [x] All API calls properly typed and error-handled
- [x] File uploads work through backend
- [x] Statistical analyses run on server-side
- [x] Frontend shows real-time progress for analyses

## üìù **Implementation Notes**

### **API Client Architecture:**
```typescript
// Planned structure:
SciFigAPI {
  auth: AuthService
  files: FileService  
  analysis: AnalysisService
  projects: ProjectService
}
```

### **Environment Setup:**
- Backend URL: `http://localhost:8000` (development)
- API prefix: `/api/v1`
- WebSocket URL: `ws://localhost:8000/ws` (future)

## üêõ **Issues & Solutions**

1. **Duplicate Function Declaration in ResultsView**
   - **Issue**: Two declarations of `runClientSideAnalysis` in ResultsView.tsx causing build errors
   - **Solution**: Removed the duplicate function and replaced with a new `updateFigure` helper function

2. **Missing Type Declarations for Plotly**
   - **Issue**: TypeScript errors for react-plotly.js and plotly.js imports
   - **Solution**: Created type declaration files (src/types/react-plotly.d.ts) with necessary interfaces

3. **Invalid Reference to Non-existent Function**
   - **Issue**: Error button referencing non-existent `runAnalysis` function
   - **Solution**: Updated error handler to use either backend or client-side analysis based on context

4. **Blank Page After ApiAuthProvider Integration**
   - **Issue**: App showed blank page after integrating ApiAuthProvider due to naming conflicts and type errors
   - **Solution**: 
     - Added ApiAuthProvider to the main.tsx file to wrap the App component
     - Created app.d.ts file with proper type declarations for navigation functions
     - Updated component props to use the NavigateFunction type
     - Fixed null vs undefined type conflicts in dataset props
