# ðŸ”— Phase 3: Frontend-Backend Integration - Progress Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ What We've Accomplished

### 1. API Client Foundation
- âœ… Created a robust TypeScript-based API client (`src/services/apiClient.ts`)
- âœ… Implemented comprehensive error handling and response typing
- âœ… Added Supabase token integration for authentication
- âœ… Organized API methods into logical service groups (auth, files, analysis)

### 2. File Upload Integration
- âœ… Connected frontend file upload component to backend API
- âœ… Added progress indicators and improved error handling
- âœ… Implemented graceful fallback to client-side processing
- âœ… Updated UI to show processing mode (local vs. server)

### 3. Statistical Analysis Integration
- âœ… Created `useBackendAnalysis` hook for server-side statistical processing
- âœ… Implemented data conversion between frontend and backend formats
- âœ… Added figure generation and regeneration capabilities
- âœ… Ensured backward compatibility with client-side processing
- âœ… Integrated with AnalysisWorkflow component
- âœ… Added real-time progress tracking with `useAnalysisProgress` hook
- âœ… Implemented animated progress indicators for better UX

### 4. Authentication Integration
- âœ… Created `useApiAuth` hook for backend authentication
- âœ… Implemented JWT token handling and session validation
- âœ… Created AuthProvider for app-wide authentication state
- âœ… Added protected route functionality with HOC pattern

### 5. Project Persistence
- âœ… Created `useProjects` hook for project management
- âœ… Implemented ProjectList component with search and filtering
- âœ… Added create, update, and delete project functionality
- âœ… Integrated with backend database via API client

### 6. Bug Fixes & Improvements
- âœ… Fixed duplicate function declarations in ResultsView
- âœ… Added TypeScript declarations for Plotly libraries
- âœ… Fixed error handling and retry functionality
- âœ… Improved code organization and reduced redundancy

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. Complete Statistical Engine Integration
- [x] Integrate `useBackendAnalysis` hook with ResultsView component
- [x] Update AnalysisSelection to pass dataset ID to analysis workflow
- [x] Add real-time progress indicators for long-running analyses
- [ ] Implement caching for analysis results

### 2. Authentication Flow
- [x] Connect React auth to backend authentication endpoints
- [x] Implement JWT token storage and refresh logic
- [x] Update protected routes with backend session validation
- [ ] Add user profile management

### 3. Project Persistence
- [x] Replace localStorage with database API calls
- [x] Implement project history and saved analyses
- [ ] Add user dashboard with persistent data
- [ ] Enable project sharing and collaboration basics

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Notes

### API Client Architecture
The API client follows a modular structure with service-based organization:

```typescript
apiClient {
  auth: { login(), signup(), logout(), me(), checkSession(), getLimits() }
  files: { upload(), getDataset(), getDatasetData(), deleteDataset() }
  analysis: { run(), get(), list(), getFigures(), regenerateFigures() }
  health: { check() }
}
```

### Backend Integration Strategy
We've implemented a hybrid approach that:
1. Uses backend processing when user is authenticated
2. Falls back to client-side processing when:
   - User is not authenticated
   - Backend is unavailable
   - Processing errors occur

This ensures a smooth user experience while leveraging the power of server-side processing when available.

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling has been implemented:
- Network errors are caught and presented to the user
- API-specific errors are parsed from response bodies
- Graceful fallbacks ensure the application remains functional
